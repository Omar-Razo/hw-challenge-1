# Module One Challenge

## Description

Given some starter code, we were tasked with refactoring the HTML and CSS present to be in line with accessibility standards as well as provide
reponsiveness to the webpage, supporting different viewports (devices). 

Semantic HTML, CSS, and media queries were the key takeaways/topics to be learned and used for the completion of this project.
